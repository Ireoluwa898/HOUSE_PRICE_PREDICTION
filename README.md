# HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION PROJECT
The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of deep learning, machine learning, ensemble
techniques in accurately predicting housing prices in the UK.
● Collect housing price data in the UK from 1995 to 2022, specifying property type, location
(town/city, postcode), and market trends. Clean and preprocess the data for effective
modeling.
● Identify the pivotal features that have a substantial impact on housing prices in the United
Kingdom.
● Examine diverse regression models to assess their effectiveness in predicting house prices.
● Compare and evaluate a range of traditional machine learning models, ensemble learning
techniques, and deep learning models to identify the most precise and dependable model
for forecasting house prices in the UK.
● Utilize ANN and LSTM to forecast house prices, examining their potential for accurate
predictions in the context of the UK housing market.
